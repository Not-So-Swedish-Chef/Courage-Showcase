## Project Overview
This application serves as a simple demonstration of a full-stack web application, showcasing how to integrate various technologies to create a seamless user experience.

## Front-End
The front-end of this project is built using **Angular Ionic** with the following features:
- **NG-Modules**: Modular architecture for better organization and reusability of code.
- **Primary Languages**: 
  - **TypeScript (.ts)**
  - **HTML (.html)**
  - **SCSS (.scss)**

## Back-End
The back-end is developed using a **C# Project** with the following components:
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: A framework for building web applications.
- **Razor**: Allows embedding C# code in HTML markup.
- **Lombok.NET**: Reduces boilerplate code via annotations.
- **Hot Reload**: A built-in feature that allows changes in the application without reloading.
- **H2Driver**: A short-term data storage solution that does not persist between application runs.
  - Not Show-Cased
- **MongoDB.Driver**: Enables connection to a MongoDB database for production use
- **Google Maps .NET Client Library**: Used to track the distance between two postal codes, allowing users to filter by distance.
  - Not Show-Cased
- **ESP with included Email API** Used to automate outgoing emails to inform families of event updates
  - Not selected at this time
  - Not Show-Cased
- **Primary Language**: 
  - **C# (.cs)**

## Server
The server is built using:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for data storage.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Primary Language**: 
  - **JavaScript (.js)**

## Technologies Used
